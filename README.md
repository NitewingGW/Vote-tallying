## Challenge overview
Learning Indentation

## Challlenge Summary
There were complications in understanding what was a part of a for loop and what was not. 
It took sometime getting used the indentation. Eventually it became a tool I could use
to figure out what variables were accessible inside and outside of the portion of the code.
Data was easy to work with but some instructions were a bit vague and i had to play with 
the indentation for hours to figure out why my code wasnt working. It was a good learning
experience.
